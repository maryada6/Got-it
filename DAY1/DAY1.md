## Problem Statement given:

>As a fan of geometry,
I want to model a line based on points consisting of (x, y) coordinates using the cartesian system,
So that I can calculate its length.

We were told the solve the given problem using TDD in ruby. <br>
* [Source code](https://github.com/maryada6/geometry)
* [3 TDD principles](https://medium.com/@rrugamba/3-laws-of-tdd-58b5ec46a998)

## Rules:

0. Should be responsible to solve problems(primary respomsibility-***You can write,delete or not write code to solve the problem***)
1. Pair programming(get different perspective and code is better)
2. Write  specs
3. Justify everything you write
4. Write meaningful names

## The Infamous Non-Negotiable Etiquettes (fail == rm -rf)
* Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent
* Use only spaces (no tabs) for indentation
* Newlines at end of file
* Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework
* Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework
* Use namespaces
* No comments/Unused Code must ever be checked in
* Runtime environment should be consistent with IDE environment - i.e there should be no difference in running a build or a spec from your IDE and from the command line
* Use .gitignore
* Ensure there is a Readme.md that includes
* Problem Description
* Dev environment setup
* Build instructions
* Run instructions
* BDD (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log - one spec, one code change per commit)

Apart from this we followed our time table and did code cycles, typing and speaking drills.
