## Problem Statement given:

>> As a fan of math,
I want to model a calculator which accepts add, subtract, multiply, divide, cancel and exit as commands,
So that I can do basic mathematics.

We were told the solve the given problem using TDD in go-lang as CLI Application.

## Session Notes (Points to remember):

1. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSV)
2. Version Control System (VCS) - (i) History (ii) Collaboration
3. Types of VCS - (i) Centralized (ii) Distributed Locally
4. Git - It is a VCS
5. Github - Service Provider for Git
6. Basic Git Commands - git config, git add, git status
7. Git Ignore Files
8. Git Stash
9. Cherry Pick in Git
10. Branch and Merging in Git
11. Pull Request (PR) in Git
12. Github Actions (CICD Workflows)
13. User Stories
14. Invest Principles in User Story - (i) Independent (ii) Negotiable (iii) Valuable (iv) Estimable (v) Small (vi) Testable
15. Advantages of User Stories
16. Acceptance Criteria
17. Estimations
18. Ideation Sprints
19. Backlog Grooming
20. Design Review
21. Sprint Planning
22. Demo and Retrospection
23. Incremental Development and Deployment
24. 7 PR Guidelines - 
(i) Each subtask can have only one owner at a given point of time. 
(ii) Individual subtask should be created as a separate branch. 
(iii) One branch one PR one subtask should be created. 
(iv) Always create a branch from master.
(v) If the PR is approved, QA is started testing, you should not be working that PR anymore.
(vi) For any issue, reopen tickets, QA may close the existing PR. In that case, you should create a new PR and send it to review.
(vii) All the ticket can be linked to click up directly with PR.
