## Session summary(notes):

We had a session with Aravind sir on composition and inheritance in OOP and then we were asked to implement the next problem statement i.e. Square (Perimeter and Area) using composition in go-Lang. Sir also spoke about pass by value and pass by reference in go-Lang. For the square problem we had to make use of Rectangle entity that we had created in our previous problem statement.

***Points to remember:***
1. Tell Don't Ask
2. Always keep data and logic together (Person Example)
3. Accept Interface and Hide Structure
4. Composition and Inheritance

Apart from this we followed our time table and did code cycles, typing and speaking drills.
