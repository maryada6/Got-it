## Session summary(notes):

* We had a session with Aravind Sir on the topic cyclomatic vs cognitive complexity. We should write small functions. Like the functions should only contain the necessary things. Class are used to define one single task using attributes and behaviour.
[Cognitive vs Cyclomatic complexity reference](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2018/05/21/is-your-code-readable-by-humans-cognitive-complexity-tells-you/)

* Then we had another session with Aravind sir on DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and on SRP (Single responsibility principle) and then we were asked to implement the above problem statement using these concepts.

***Points to remember:***

1. Functions / methods should be small
2. Do one thing and do it well
3. Prefer fewer arguments in methods
4. Use descriptive names
5. A function or method should not do anything other than what its name describes (Have no side effects)
6. Cyclometric and Cognitive Complexity
7. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
8. Classes should be small
9. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
