So that I can add values of money.

We were told the solve the given problem using TDD in go-lang. <br>[Source code](https://github.com/maryada6/currency)

***Points to remember:***

1. Write test cases in an orderly manner.
2. Trade-off between memory and thread safty.
3. Sunk cost( a cost that has already been incurred and that cannot be recovered. In economic decision making, sunk costs are treated as bygone and are not taken into consideration when deciding whether to continue an investment project).
4. Project involves quality, scope and time. Never compromise on quality. Either reduce scope or extend time.
5. Fallacy - a false or mistaken idea
6. Argumentum - do not follow any accepted idea blindly.(open source code stars example)
7. Confirmation bias - A confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that involves favoring information that confirms your previously existing beliefs or biases.

### Points to go through

1. Synchronous vs asynchronous( [Reference](https://www.trio.dev/blog/synchronous-and-asynchronous) )
2. Mutable vs immutable( [Refernece](https://www.javatpoint.com/mutable-and-immutable-in-java) )
3. Singleton( [Refernece](https://betterprogramming.pub/what-is-a-singleton-2dc38ca08e92) )
4. Concurrency and Parallelism( [Refernce](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism/#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20the%20task%20of,of%20running%20multiple%20computations%20simultaneously.) )

Apart from this we followed our time table and did code cycles, typing and speaking drills.
